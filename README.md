Data Preprocessing Summary:

The target variable, "IS_SUCCESSFUL", indicates the success of an organization's investment.
Feature variables include all columns except "IS_SUCCESSFUL".
"EIN" and "NAME" columns were removed as they didn't influence success determination.
Model Compilation, Training, and Evaluation Summary:

The model has 80 neurons across three layers with the 'relu' activation function.
Despite efforts, the model's highest accuracy was 73%, below the target of 75%.
Attempts to improve accuracy included adjusting layers, neurons, epochs, and activation functions.
